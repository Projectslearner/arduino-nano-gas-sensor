# Gas Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Gas Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Nano to monitor the output of a gas sensor. This project is essential for detecting the presence of gases in various environments, making it suitable for applications such as air quality monitoring, gas leak detection, and safety systems.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Gas Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Gas Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the gas sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure the power and ground connections of the gas sensor are appropriately connected to the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the gas sensor to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the gas sensor values displayed on the serial monitor to detect changes in gas concentration.

#### Applications

- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Detect and monitor the concentration of harmful gases in indoor or outdoor environments.
- **Gas Leak Detection:** Alert users to the presence of gas leaks in industrial or residential settings.
- **Safety Systems:** Integrate gas sensors into safety systems to prevent accidents and protect human health.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connection between the gas sensor and the Arduino Nano.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary to adjust for different gas types or concentration ranges.
- Experiment with different delay values in the code to optimize the monitoring frequency or responsiveness.
